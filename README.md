The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset often used for practicing machine learning techniques. It contains information about passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912, including whether they survived or not.

Data Dictionary
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Gender: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age in years (fractional if less than 1)
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation 

Notes
Missing values: The dataset contains missing values for some attributes (e.g., 'Age', 'Cabin'). 
Feature engineering: Additional features can be derived from existing ones, such as extracting titles from passenger names or grouping ages into categories.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore relationships between variables, check for correlations, and visualize distributions to understand the data better.
Machine Learning: After preprocessing and feature engineering, various machine learning algorithms are applied to predict survival.
